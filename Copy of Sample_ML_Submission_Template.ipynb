Among these platforms, Zomato plays a major role by providing restaurant information, ratings, and customer reviews that influence consumer decisions. The purpose of this project, ZomatoPulse, is to analyze restaurant reviews and metadata from Zomato to extract meaningful insights about customer preferences, restaurant performance, and overall dining trends using data analysis techniques.\n","\n","This project uses two datasets: one containing restaurant reviews and another containing restaurant names along with their associated metadata such as location, cuisine type, ratings, and cost details. By combining these datasets, the project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns hidden within the data. The analysis focuses on understanding customer sentiment, identifying highly rated restaurants, observing trends across locations and cuisines, and studying how different factors influence customer ratings.\n","\n","The first phase of the project involves data loading and preprocessing. This includes importing the datasets into the Python environment using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The data is inspected to understand its structure, size, and key attributes. Missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies are identified and handled appropriately to ensure data quality. Text-based review data is cleaned by removing unnecessary symbols, converting text to a consistent format, and preparing it for further analysis.\n","\n","Once the data is cleaned, exploratory data analysis is conducted to uncover important insights. Descriptive statistics are used to understand rating distributions, review counts, and cost variations across restaurants. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends such as the most popular cuisines, locations with the highest-rated restaurants, and relationships between pricing and customer satisfaction. These visual representations make it easier to interpret complex patterns in the data.\n","\n","A key focus of the project is understanding customer sentiment through reviews. By analyzing review text, the project examines how positive and negative feedback correlates with ratings. Frequently used words and phrases in reviews are explored to understand what customers value most, such as food quality, service, ambiance, or pricing. This helps identify the strengths and weaknesses of restaurants from a customer perspective.\n","\n","The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable for multiple stakeholders. Customers can use these insights to make informed dining choices. Restaurant owners can understand customer expectations and areas for improvement. Food delivery platforms like Zomato can leverage such analysis to enhance recommendation systems and improve user experience.\n","\n","In conclusion, ZomatoPulse demonstrates how real-world data can be transformed into actionable insights using data analysis techniques. The project highlights the importance of data cleaning, exploration, and visualization in extracting meaningful information from large datasets. It also provides a strong foundation for future work, such as implementing machine learning models for sentiment classification or building recommendation systems. Overall, this project showcases practical applications of data analytics in the food and restaurant industry and reinforces the value of data-driven decision-making."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.To analyze Zomato restaurant data and understand customer rating patterns.\n","\n","2.To identify positive and negative sentiments from customer reviews.\n","\n","3To clean and preprocess raw restaurant review text for analysis.\n","\n","4.To perform exploratory data analysis to find trends in ratings and reviews.\n","\n","5.To convert textual reviews into numerical features for machine learning.\n","\n","6.To build and compare multiple machine learning models for sentiment classification.\n","\n","7.To evaluate model performance using suitable evaluation metrics.\n","\n","8.To use customer feedback insights to support better business decisions."],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "],"metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
